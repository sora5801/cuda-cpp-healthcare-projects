# Data — 10.5 Gait & Motion-Capture Biomechanics

## Committed sample (`sample/`)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| File | `sample/saxpy_sample.txt` |
| Origin | **Synthetic** (generated; template placeholder) |
| License | Public domain (CC0) — it is synthetic |
| Size | < 1 KB |
| Layout | line 1: `n`; line 2: `a`; line 3: `n` x-values; line 4: `n` y-values |

This tiny file lets `demo/run_demo` run **offline, with zero downloads**, which
is a hard requirement for every project (CLAUDE.md §8).

TODO(impl): replace with this project's real tiny sample, and document each
field's meaning, units, and provenance below.

## Full dataset

TODO(impl): describe the real dataset(s) from the catalog and how to fetch them:

- **Source / URL:** (from the catalog "Datasets" column)
- **License:** respect it. If redistribution is forbidden, the committed sample
  MUST be synthetic and `make_synthetic.py` provides a stand-in.
- **Size & checksum:** documented in `scripts/download_data.*`.
- **Credentialed sets** (MIMIC, UK Biobank, ...): the download script must NOT
  bypass registration — it prints instructions and links only.

Catalog dataset notes (verbatim):

> GaitRec — 2,084 patient bilateral ground reaction force (GRF) walking trials + 211 healthy controls (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0481-z); CMU Motion Capture Database — 2500+ mocap sequences across diverse activities (http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/); PhysioNet Gait/Posture Database — multi-camera + 17-IMU multimodal gait (https://physionet.org/content/multi-gait-posture/1.0.0/); Gait120 — comprehensive EMG + kinematic dataset (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12177048/).

## Provenance & field meanings

TODO(impl): per-field meaning for the real dataset. Never imply clinical
validity; label synthetic data as synthetic everywhere it appears.
